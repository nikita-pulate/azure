## 1. Current ARM Architecture Overview

Every single action in Azure — whether from the Portal, CLI, PowerShell, SDKs, or Terraform — flows through *one unified API layer: Azure Resource Manager (ARM). This is what makes Azure's management experience *consistent no matter which tool you pick.


### Request Flow (Step-by-Step)

```bash
1. You send a request
   (Portal click / az command / PowerShell cmdlet / REST call / Template)
                        │
                        ▼
2. Authentication (Microsoft Entra ID)
   → Confirms WHO you are
                        │
                        ▼
3. Authorization (Azure RBAC)
   → Confirms WHAT you're allowed to do
                        │
                        ▼
4. ARM validates the request
   → Checks syntax, resource provider, API version, policies
                        │
                        ▼
5. Request routed to the correct Resource Provider
   → e.g., Microsoft.Compute, Microsoft.Storage, Microsoft.Network
                        │
                        ▼
6. Resource Provider executes the action
   → Resource is created / updated / deleted
                        │
                        ▼
7. ARM returns the result + logs it to Activity Log
```

## Resource manager 
- Azure Resource Manager is the deployment and management service for Azure.
- which manages all the resources created in Azure cloud

## resource group - A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group includes those resources that you want to manage as a group.

## Classic vs ARM

## Understanding ARM template 
- *JSON* syntax files to create an manage Azure resources
- uses Declarative syntax
- focuses on what you want to create


  ## Benefits of ARM template 
- IAC : scripts 
- idempotent deployments : repetitive task can be skip and all the resources created silmilar 
- Orchestrated Deployment : manage infrastructure 
- build in validation : redeployment checks

### 🧪 Practice Lab
1. In Cloud Shell (Bash), create two resource groups:
  ```bash
   az group create --name rg-scope-lab-1 --location eastus
   az group create --name rg-scope-lab-2 --location westus
   ```
2. Create a storage account in rg-scope-lab-1:
  ```bash
   az storage account create --name scopelabstorage123 --resource-group rg-scope-lab-1 --location eastus --sku Standard_LRS
   ```
3. *Move* it to rg-scope-lab-2:
  ``` bash
   az resource move --destination-group rg-scope-lab-2 \
     --ids $(az storage account show --name scopelabstorage123 --resource-group rg-scope-lab-1 --query id -o tsv)
   ```
4. Confirm it now lives in rg-scope-lab-2:
   ``` bash
   az resource list --resource-group rg-scope-lab-2 --output table
   ```
5. Clean up: az group delete --name rg-scope-lab-1 --yes and az group delete --name rg-scope-lab-2 --yes
