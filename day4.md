## 1. Planning for Azure VM Deployment

### What is an Azure VM?
An *Azure Virtual Machine (VM)* is an *on-demand, scalable compute resource* — essentially a full server (OS + apps) running inside Azure's infrastructure. It's Azure's core *Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)* offering.

### Planning Checklist (Before You Deploy)
Good VM planning answers these questions *before* clicking "Create":


| Question | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| *What workload will run on it?* | Determines OS, VM size/series, and disk type |
| *Which region?* | Affects latency, compliance/data residency, pricing, and available VM sizes |
| *Do I need high availability?* | Determines if you need Availability Zones / Availability Sets |
| *What's my budget?* | Determines VM series, disk tier, and pricing model (Pay-As-You-Go vs Reserved vs Spot) |
| *Networking requirements?* | Determines VNet, subnet, NSG, and public IP needs |
| *Security & identity needs?* | Determines managed identity, RBAC, disk encryption |
| *How will I manage it long-term?* | Determines backup, monitoring, and patching strategy |



### The 4 Pillars of VM Planning
1. *Compute* → OS + VM size/series
2. *Storage* → Managed disk type(s)
3. *Networking* → Region, VNet, NSG, Public IP
4. *Resiliency* → Availability Zones/Sets, backup strategy

## 2. Selecting OS, VM Size, and Disk Types

### A) Operating System
Azure supports both:
- *Windows Server* (various versions) — licensing included in VM cost
- *Linux* (Ubuntu, Red Hat, SUSE, Debian, etc.) — many free/open-source images, some paid (e.g., RHEL)

*Choosing factors:* application compatibility, team's OS skillset, licensing cost, and available VM extensions/tools for that OS.

### B) VM Size (Series)
VM size = how much *CPU, RAM, temp storage, and network bandwidth* the VM gets. Sizes are grouped into *series/families* (covered in depth in Section 5).

*Quick decision guide:*
| Workload | Recommended Family |
|---|---|
| Dev/test, small apps | General Purpose (B, A, D-series) |
| Databases, in-memory caching | Memory Optimized (E-series) |
| Batch processing, analytics, gaming servers | Compute Optimized (F-series) |
| Big data, storage-heavy workloads | Storage Optimized (L-series) |
| AI/ML, rendering, visualization | GPU (N-series) |

### C) Disk Type
Every VM needs at least an *OS disk, and often one or more **data disks*. Disk type controls performance (IOPS/throughput) and cost — covered in depth in Section 6.

### Putting It Together — A Simple Selection Flow
```bash
1. Pick OS based on app compatibility
        │
        ▼
2. Estimate CPU/RAM needs → pick VM family → pick specific size
        │
        ▼
3. Estimate I/O needs (database? web server? batch job?) → pick disk type
        │
        ▼
4. Validate: does the chosen region support this VM size + disk combo?
```

## 3. Understanding Regions and Availability Zones

### Azure Regions
A *region* is a set of datacenters connected by a low-latency network, deployed within a general geographic area. <cite index="81-1">An Azure region consists of one or more datacenters, connected by a high-capacity, fault-tolerant, low-latency network connection, typically located within a large metropolitan area.</cite>

- Every resource you deploy is tied to a region (e.g., East US, West Europe, Southeast Asia)
- Not every service/VM size is available in every region — always check availability first


### Availability Zones (AZs)
<cite index="81-1">Availability zones are independent sets of datacenters within a region that have isolated power, cooling, and network connections, physically located close enough to provide low-latency networking but far enough apart for fault isolation from local disasters like storms or power outages.</cite>

- Most regions with AZ support offer *at least 3 zones*
- Deploying VMs across zones protects against a *datacenter-level failure*, not just a single server/rack failure

### Resiliency Options Compared

| Option | Protects Against | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| *Availability Set* | Hardware failure (single rack/switch/power source) within one datacenter | Same datacenter |
| *Availability Zone* | Entire datacenter failure (power, cooling, network outage) | Same region, different physical datacenters |
| *Region Pair* | Entire region failure (large-scale disaster) | Different, geographically separated regions |

### Why This Matters for VM Planning
- *Mission-critical workloads* → deploy across Availability Zones *and* consider multi-region for disaster recovery
- *Simple dev/test VM* → a single zone/region is usually fine
- Choosing a region also affects *latency to your users, **data residency/compliance, and **pricing* (prices vary by region)

## 4. Pricing and Cost Estimations

### What Drives VM Cost?
| Factor | Impact |
|---|---|
| *VM size/series* | More vCPU/RAM = higher hourly cost |
| *Region* | Prices vary — some regions are cheaper than others |
| *OS* | Windows VMs typically cost more (licensing) than Linux |
| *Disk type & size* | Premium/Ultra disks cost more than Standard HDD |
| *Uptime* | You're billed for compute while the VM is running (stopped-deallocated VMs don't incur compute charges, but disks still do) |
| *Pricing model* | Pay-As-You-Go vs Reserved Instances vs Spot VMs vs Savings Plan |

### Pricing Models
| Model | Best For | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| *Pay-As-You-Go* | Unpredictable/short-term workloads | Highest hourly rate, full flexibility |
| *Reserved Instances (1 or 3 yr)* | Steady, predictable long-term workloads | Big discount, but committed spend |
| *Azure Savings Plan* | Flexible steady usage across VM types | Discount with less rigidity than Reserved |
| *Spot VMs* | Interruptible/batch workloads (can be evicted) | Cheapest option, but Azure can reclaim the VM anytime |
| *Azure Hybrid Benefit* | Orgs with existing Windows Server/SQL licenses | Reuse on-prem licenses to cut Azure cost |


### Estimating Costs Before Deployment
- *Azure Pricing Calculator* — <cite index="94-1">estimates costs based on region, size, operating system, tier, and other specific features, pulling per-unit pricing from the Azure Retail Prices API</cite>
- *Azure Migrate / TCO tooling* — for comparing on-premises infrastructure costs against equivalent Azure costs when planning a migration
- *Cost Management + Billing (in-portal)* — track actual spend after deployment, set budgets and alerts

## 5. Azure VM Series/Types (Instance Types)

### The Naming Convention
Azure VM names follow a pattern like Standard_D4s_v5:
- *D* = Family/series (workload type)
- *4* = Number of vCPUs
- *s* = Premium storage capable
- *v5* = Version generation

### Main VM Families

| Family | Optimized For | Typical Use Cases |
|---|---|---|
| *A-series* | Entry-level, general purpose | Dev/test, small databases, low-traffic web servers |
| *B-series* | Burstable general purpose (CPU credits) | Small workloads with occasional spikes (e.g., dev boxes) |
| *D-series* | Balanced general purpose | Enterprise apps, web/app servers, moderate-traffic production |
| *E-series* | Memory optimized | In-memory databases (SQL, SAP HANA), analytics, caching |
| *F-series* | Compute optimized (high CPU-to-memory ratio) | Batch processing, network appliances, medium-traffic web servers |
| *L-series* | Storage optimized (high disk throughput/IOPS) | Big data, NoSQL databases (Cassandra, MongoDB) |
| *N-series* | GPU-accelerated | AI/ML training, visualization, rendering, gaming |
| *H-series (HPC)* | High Performance Computing | Simulations, computational fluid dynamics, financial risk modeling |

### How B-series Bursting Works (Good Teaching Example)
<cite index="67-1">B-series VMs are the only Azure VM type that uses a CPU credit model: the VM accumulates credits while running below its baseline CPU performance, and spends those credits to "burst" above baseline when needed, until credits run out — then it's throttled back to baseline until credits rebuild.</cite> This makes B-series great (and cheap) for workloads that are mostly idle with occasional spikes.

### Choosing a Series — Quick Rule of Thumb
- *"I don't know yet, just testing"* → B-series or D-series
- *"Lots of RAM needed (database)"* → E-series
- *"Lots of CPU needed (processing)"* → F-series
- *"Need a GPU"* → N-series
- *"Massive local disk I/O"* → L-series

## 6. Azure Managed Disk Types

### What Are Managed Disks?
<cite index="73-1">Azure managed disks are block-level storage volumes managed by Azure and used with Azure Virtual Machines — virtualized versions of physical disks in an on-premises server. You only specify the disk type and size, then Azure handles provisioning and the rest.</cite>

### The 5 Disk Types

| Disk Type | Performance | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| *Standard HDD* | Lowest cost, higher latency | Backup, infrequently accessed/archival data, dev/test |
| *Standard SSD* | <cite index="76-1">Designed to deliver write latencies under 10 ms and read latencies under 20 ms for most operations</cite> | Web servers, lightly used apps, dev/test environments |
| *Premium SSD* | High IOPS, low latency, consistent performance | Production workloads, databases, performance-sensitive apps |
| *Premium SSD v2* | Independently configurable size/IOPS/throughput | Production workloads needing fine-tuned performance at lower cost than Ultra |
| *Ultra Disk* | <cite index="77-1">Azure's highest-performing storage option, allowing performance parameters to be changed without restarting the VM</cite> | <cite index="77-1">Data-intensive, transaction-heavy workloads such as SAP HANA and top-tier databases</cite> |

### Important Rules to Teach
- <cite index="77-1">Ultra Disks must be used as data disks only (not OS disks) and can only be created as empty disks — when using them, pair with a Premium SSD as the OS disk.</cite>
- OS disk vs Data disk: the *OS disk* holds the operating system; *data disks* hold your application data — you can attach multiple data disks to one VM
- <cite index="72-1">You can easily switch between Premium SSD, Standard SSD, and Standard HDD based on performance needs, and Premium SSD and Standard SSD are also available with zone-redundant storage — but disk type conversion requires a VM restart.</cite>

### Simple Decision Guide
```bash
Is it mission-critical / needs ultra-low latency (e.g., SAP HANA)?
        → Ultra Disk (data) + Premium SSD (OS)

Is it a standard production workload (business app, SQL DB)?
        → Premium SSD or Premium SSD v2

Is it a web server / dev-test / light workload?
        → Standard SSD

Is it backup / rarely accessed / cost is #1 priority?
        → Standard HDD
```
